# Technique
##  React
I decided to use React because I was instructed to choose either, If I was instructed otherwise I would have just followed the instructions. And I'm confident that, as a software developer you must be very flexible because technology is changing very rapidly.

# Improvements
There is just so many improvements that can be done to any project really.
Functions can be very simple but again very complex and perform magnificent  things.
Just for Example on our website we could interact with users allowing them to create playlists, watch lists, invite friends, group theater etc.

# Deadline
If the deadline would be pushed far I could just freestyle  artistically all over the website. I could add Animations and sliders, I could add Payment for VIP members with exclusive access. I could add a backend system to support our front end making sure everything is running seamlessly over the network
